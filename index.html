			<h2>About the author</h2>
			<p>
				Ursula K Le Guin was born in 1929 in Berkeley, California to an 
				artistically and intellectually vibrant home. 
				She struggled initially to be published in the mainstream fiction world, 
				but her first three novels, Rocannon's World, Planet of Exile and City of Illusions, 
				put her on the sci-fi map.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2008, 40 years later, Le Guin made literary news with Lavinia, 
				a metatextual examination of a minor character from Virgil's Aeneid. 
				Le Guin was also widely known for her globally popular Earthsea fantasy series. 
				She wrote essays on fantasy fiction and feminist issues as well, 
				and was awarded the Living Legend Medal by the Library of Congress, 
				among a plethora of career honors. 
				Le Guin died at her home in Portland, Oregon, on January 22, 2018, at age 88.

			<h2>Influence and legacy</h2>
			<p>
				Le Guin had a considerable influence on the field of speculative fiction; 
				Jo Walton argued that Le Guin played a large role in both broadening the genre
				and helping genre writers achieve mainstream recognition. 
				The Earthsea books are cited as having a wide impact, including outside the field of literature.
				Atwood considers A Wizard of Earthsea one of the "wellsprings" of fantasy literature,
				and modern writers have credited the book for the idea of a "wizard school", 
				later made famous by the Harry Potter series of books, and with popularizing the trope of a boy wizard,
				also present in Harry Potter. 
				The notion that names can exert power is a theme in the Earthsea series; 
				critics have suggested that this inspired Hayao Miyazaki's use of the idea 
				in his 2001 film Spirited Away.
			</p>
			<p>
				Neil Gaiman is among the many authors who have acknowledged Le Guin's influence	on their own writing. 
				Le Guin's writings set in the Hainish universe also had a wide influence. 
				Le Guin coined the name "ansible" for an instantaneous interstellar communication device in 1966; 
				the term was later adopted by several other writers, including Orson Scott Card in the Ender Series and 
				Neil Gaiman in a script for a Doctor Who episode.
				Suzanne Reid wrote that at the time The Left Hand of Darkness was written, 
				Le Guin's ideas of androgyny were unique not only to science fiction, 
				but to literature in general. 
				That volume is specifically cited as leaving a large legacy; 
				in discussing it, literary critic Harold Bloom wrote 
				"Le Guin, more than Tolkien, has raised fantasy into high literature, for our time".
				Bloom followed this up by listing the book in his The Western Canon (1994) as one of the books
				in his conception of artistic works that have been important and influential in Western culture.
				This view was echoed in The Paris Review, which wrote that 
				"No single work did more to upend the genre's conventions than The Left Hand of Darkness",
				while White argued that it was one of the seminal works of science fiction, 
				as important as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818).
			</p>
			<p>
				Commentators have also described Le Guin as being influential in the field of literature more generally. 
				Literary critic Elaine Showalter suggested that Le Guin 
				"set the pace as a writer for women unlearning silence, fear, and self-doubt", 
				while writer Brian Attebery stated that "Le Guin invented us: science fiction and fantasy critics
				like me but also poets and essayists and picture book writers and novelists".
				Le Guin's own literary criticism proved influential; 
				her 1973 essay "From Elfland to Poughkeepsie" led to renewed interest in the work of Kenneth Morris,
				and eventually to the publication of a posthumous novel by Morris.
				Le Guin also played a role in bringing speculative fiction into the literary mainstream
				by supporting journalists and scholarly endeavors examining the genre.

				A writer is a person who cares what words mean, what they say, how they say it. 
				Writers know words are their way towards truth and freedom, 
				and so they use them with care, with thought, with fear, with delight. 
				By using words well they strengthen their souls. Story-tellers and poets 
				spend their lives learning that skill and art of using words well. 
				And their words make the souls of their readers stronger, brighter, deeper.
